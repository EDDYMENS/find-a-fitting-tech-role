<h2>Dev Ops</h2>
<p>Software infrastructure has greatly evolved over the years. This evolution has revolved around better management and orchestration.</p>
<p>In lay-man terms creating and managing servers has become a streamlined process with developers becoming a lot more involved in the process.</p>
<p>In the past developers wrote software and had to discuss the kind of infrastructure required to run it with server administrators. These days dev op engineers manage platforms that allow developers to describe the kind of infrastructure they will need in code.</p>
<h3>Coding</h3>
<p>You will need to be very good at scripting for the most part.</p>
<h3>Working in teams</h3>
<p>Dev Ops engineers can work solo or in a team with other dev op engineers.</p>
<h3>Working alone</h3>
<p>You can pick up this role in a consulting capacity and have no problems.</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>Dev Ops engineers manage the underlying infrastructure on top of which software solutions run. Importantly they make it possible for developers to just focus on the software solution they are working on.</p>
<h3>Managing a team</h3>
<p>You likely won't be managing a team.</p>
<h3>Dealing with customers</h3>
<p>You won't be interacting with the end customer.</p>
<h3>Learning Curve</h3>
<p>Besides learning scripting in a programming language, you will have to learn tools needed to work on particular cloud infrastructures and this can be hard for beginners who have never programmed beforehand.</p>
