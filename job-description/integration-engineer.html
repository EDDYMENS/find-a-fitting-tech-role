<h2>Integration Engineer</h2>
<p>For very technical software products, the vendor might need to have an integration engineer on deck to work with the customer to integrate their solution.</p>
<h3>Coding</h3>
<p>Generally, the integration engineer will need some coding knowledge in other to help customers integrate their tech.
The level and the tech stack to learn depends heavily on the company's product.</p>
<h3>Working in teams</h3>
<p>An integration engineer usually has to work together with either a sales or business associate. They will also be working closely with developers to better understand the product.</p>
<h3>Working alone</h3>
<p>Integration engineers will hardly be found working alone, as they have to work closely with associates and clients.</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>Without integration engineers, companies might have a lot of friction onboarding new customers.</p>
<h3>Managing a team</h3>
<p>You don't need to manage a team to do your job but might find yourself managing a team if the integrations team is big enough.</p>
<h3>Dealing with customers</h3>
<p>You will spend most of your time interacting with end customers.</p>
<h3>Learning Curve</h3>
<p>You can start out with whatever technology you want, but the most important skill set is being able to pick up any technology relatively fast. So the best approach will be to engrave yourself in the basics of software development.</p>
