<h3>Working in teams</h3>
<p>This is non-existent.</p>
<h3>Working alone</h3>
<p>This is what it's all about</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of what you work on will depend on the product idea.</p>
<h3>Managing a team</h3>

<h3>Dealing with customers</h3>
<p>Since it's just you running the show you will have to deal directly with the end-users of your product. If you make an income through say google ads you might not have to deal with end customers.</p>
<h3>Learning Curve</h3>
